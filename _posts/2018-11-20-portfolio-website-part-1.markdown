# How to start with a Portfolio Website

A portfolio website is your own space where you can experiment and showcase your skills. It is also a platform for others to view your profile, skill-sets, existing projects and more! There are tons of blogs about how to create a portfolio website using React (which will also be covered in subsequent posts), but I feel that the tutorial should start from the content - which sections to add in your portfolio website?

The most basic of any portfolio website should include the following content:
+ Intro
+ About
+ Projects
+ Contact Details

## Intro

Intro is the most important section of the portfolio website. It should be short and meaningful enough to describe about yourself completely. Ideally, an intro should span 2-3 lines and should include what you are currently doing and any past accomplishment or educational details. The intro establishes your identity for the reader and it is essential for it to be less flashy and more informative, at best.

For e.g.:
> Hi, I am Nikhil Mehta. Welcome to my portfolio website.
Has a lesser effect than:
> I am a CS Grad student who loves to explore new JS Frameworks and reading books!

The intent of intro is to capture the attention of the viewer so that he/she would be willing to explore all the content of the website.
