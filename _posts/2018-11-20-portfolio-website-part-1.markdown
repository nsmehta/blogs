# How to start with a Portfolio Website

A portfolio website is your own space where you can experiment and showcase your skills. It is also a platform for others to view your profile, skill-sets, existing projects and more! There are tons of blogs about how to create a portfolio website using React (which will also be covered in subsequent posts), but I feel that the tutorial should start from the content - which sections to add in your portfolio website?

The most basic of any portfolio website should include the following content:
+ Intro
+ About
+ Projects
+ Contact Details

## Intro

Intro is the most important section of the portfolio website. It should be short and meaningful enough to describe about yourself completely. Ideally, an intro should span 2-3 lines and should include what you are currently doing and any past accomplishment or educational details. The intro establishes your identity for the reader and it is essential for it to be less flashy and more informative, at best.

For e.g.:
> Hi, I am Nikhil Mehta. Welcome to my portfolio website.

Has a lesser effect than:

> I am a CS Grad student who loves to explore new JS Frameworks and reading books!

The intent of intro is to capture the attention of the viewer so that he/she would be willing to explore all the content of the website.

It can also include one of your recent achievements or your current work. This helps to provide some highlights about what you have been doing.

> I am a Teaching Assistant at Stony Brook University.

One more thing that will instantly light up the Intro page is you! Yes, your photo = you. A good photo can make the a lot of difference. Also, a photograph does not require you to write any content and still fills up a significant portion of the webpage. A fuller webpage is a better webpage, in most cases. It is important that the photograph shows you - and not you with a bunch of people. Your individuality should be rightly expressed by *your* photograph since this is *your* website.

A general rule of thumb for your photograph is that it should be lively. We want to see you smiling and welcoming the viewers to your website and not frowning to ask them to leave. Again, avoid it from being too flashy while at the same time you can experiment with it and have a casual photograph as well. Since, this is a portfolio website - which is different from your LinkedIn profile - you can take some liberties.

Which one out of these 2 would you prefer? Bottomline - welcome viewers with a good photo.
