# How to start with a Tech Portfolio Website

A portfolio website is your own space where you can experiment and showcase your skills. It is also a platform for others to view your profile, skill-sets, existing projects and more! There are tons of blogs about how to create a portfolio website using React (which will also be covered in subsequent posts), but I feel that the tutorial should start from the content - which sections to add in your portfolio website?

The most basic of any portfolio website should include the following content:
+ Intro
+ About
+ Projects
+ Contact Details

## Intro

Intro is the most important section of the portfolio website. It should be short and meaningful enough to describe about yourself completely. Ideally, an intro should span 2-3 lines and should include what you are currently doing and any past accomplishment or educational details. The intro establishes your identity for the reader and it is essential for it to be less flashy and more informative, at best.

For e.g.:
> Hi, I am Nikhil Mehta. Welcome to my portfolio website.

Has a lesser effect than:

> I am a CS Grad student who loves to explore new JS Frameworks and reading books!

The intent of intro is to capture the attention of the viewer so that he/she would be willing to explore all the content of the website.

It can also include one of your recent achievements or your current work. This helps to provide some highlights about what you have been doing.

> I am a Teaching Assistant at Stony Brook University.

One more thing that will instantly light up the Intro page is you! Yes, your photo = you. A good photo can make the a lot of difference. Also, a photograph does not require you to write any content and still fills up a significant portion of the webpage. A fuller webpage is a better webpage, in most cases. It is important that the photograph shows you - and not you with a bunch of people. Your individuality should be rightly expressed by *your* photograph since this is *your* website.

A general rule of thumb for your photograph is that it should be lively. We want to see you smiling and welcoming the viewers to your website and not frowning to ask them to leave. Again, avoid it from being too flashy while at the same time you can experiment with it and have a casual photograph as well. Since, this is a portfolio website - which is different from your LinkedIn profile - you can take some liberties.

<img src="/blogs/images/img_2.jpg" alt="Smile" style="width:250px;"/>

Which one out of these 2 would you prefer? Bottomline - welcome viewers with a good photo.

Next, we will move on to the **About** section.

## About

The About section is an extension of the Intro section itself. After someone has gone through your intro and wants to know more, we have About section just for that. You can be more flexible in this section by including additional details, such as your work history, your academic history and other *general* information about yourself.

**Tip:** Please include details in the form of bullet points. It helps the viewers skim through it quickly. Bullet points and/or tables are more readable and should be preferred.

Your current and past work, your experience, etc all goes in this section. Its a summary of your entire professional profile and should include every detail that would normally be added on your resume. This section is like a resume, with more space to add content that wouldn't fit in your resume. Remember, this section is *about* you and its content reflects everything that you want the viewer to know about you.

You can include your current and past education, your majors and GPA. The places you have worked at will also be a part of this section - include a brief summary about each of your work experience as well as the duration for which you have worked there. A chronological order of these details helps the viewer understand how you have been making professional decisions.

## Projects

Project section, as the name suggests, includes all your present and past projects. Be sure to include all the details about your projects - the technologies used, the duration of the project, which sections did you work on, the team size and the description of the project. Such details are important for the viewer to know which technologies do you know as well as for how long have you been using them.

**Tip:** Please include GitHub links for your open-source projects - this helps the viewer to check your project in more depth and gauge your contribution in it.

The projects can be arranged in 2 ways: chronologically or in the order of prominence. Be sure to have your star projects on top as the viewer might not go through *all* of your dozens of projects. Keep updating your portfolio website with the latest projects that you have been working on - this section will be the most edited section of your website.

The projects can be divided into academic as well as professional projects. Do not include properietary details about your professional projects! You may partition this section based on your accademic and professional projects. Remember, include all of your *relevant* projects - the Hello World projects that you worked on for an hour can be avoided here.

## Contact Details

This section looks very obvious - that is should contain your email address and other information for people to reach out to you. **NO!** This section has an added significance. Include all your professional links, such as LinkedIn, GitHub and StackOverflow in this section. A downloadable version of your resume would also be desirable. Besides this, you may include information about your references, the recommendations that you have received as well the people you have worked with. It need not be a run-of-the-mill boring section. Include all these details, highlight them well and it becomes a very important section, especially for job seekers.

Make sure that all the information is valid as well as you have permission from your colleagues and references to include any information about them. It is important that such professional ethics are athered to even for your persona website.

## What else?

Color scheme of your website is as important as the contents. Just like your photograph, the  color scheme should be welcoming. It should not be too dull nor too bright. You can use the standard Blue-and-White color scheme used by LinkedIn and Facebook or you can experiment with other colors. Each section of your website can also have a different color! It is easy to experiment on this and come up with something that is pleasing to the eyes.

The structure of the website is something that should be worked on *before* starting to create the website. All the sections should be part of the overall theme of the website and one section should not be too different in its structure that it desn't feel like it belongs there! It is very easy to go wrong on this when you are busy experimenting with different themes and you feel that all the themes are good - and you include all of them. The aesthetics help the viewer find comfort while going through your website and it should be given as much time as the actual contents.

The URL of the website is something that you will be providing to others and adding it in your resume. Take efforts to make sure that the website URL is a reflection of your profile. Having your name in the URL or a personal web address speaks a lot about the importance you give to your webpage.

This is [my webpage](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~nsmehta/).

## What next?

We need to move to the part where we see how do we stitch all these sections together using React and actually deploy our website. That will follow in another blog. I will keep you posted!
